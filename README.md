## TO ASK
- can we stick to the data if goodnes of fit test indicates that the model is not well fitted for the data

## TODO
- ~~determine wether we should use Probit/Logit~~
- marginal effects for user defined characteristics
- Hosmer-Lemeshow and Osius-Rojekt test for goodness of fit 
- Wald.test for hypothesis testing
